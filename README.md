# Ad Click Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a user will click on an ad based on their **time spent on the site** and **salary**. The goal is to help businesses improve ad targeting and understand user behavior.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Facebook Ads Data  
- **Features Used:**  
  - Time Spent on Site (in minutes)  
  - Salary  
- **Target:** Clicked (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)  
- Power BI for visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook (via Anaconda)

## 📈 Results

- Best model: **[mention best model]**  
- Accuracy: **[e.g., 87%]**  
- Key insight: Users with higher site time and mid-range salary showed higher ad click rates

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook  
3. Run the cells to preprocess, train models, and evaluate

## 📸 Visualizations

Power BI dashboard included for churn trends, feature importance, and prediction output
